    <h3 > Portland Museum of Art Energy Usage Visualization </h3>
    <h4>The data for the graphics in this dashboard comes from data generously provided by the Portland Museum of Art (PMA). </h4>
   <h4> Our goal was to take that data and create a series of visualizations to communicate the state of energy usage at the museum. </h4>
       <br>
    <h4>The following graphics give an overview of the energy consumption data for the various buildings of the Portland Museum of Art's (PMA) campus. </h4>
        <h4>The first two graphics show a general overview of the museum's energy usage, and those seeking a more in-depth analysis can look further into more exploratory visuals in the latter two graphics. </h4>

    <!-- EXPLANATORY GRAPHICS -->
    <!-- Total Yearly Energy Usage by Building -->

    <h2>Total Energy Usage By Building</h2>
    <p> <i>This graphic shows the total energy consumption for each building. Each energy type has been standardized into a single unit of measure and then summed to create these totals. </i></p>

<!-- Total Anual Energy Usage by Building -->
<h2> Total Yearly Energy Usage by Building </h2>   
    <p> <i> This graphic is similar to the previous one, but it gives a snapshot of a given year for the selected building. </i></p>

    <!-- EXPLORITORY GRAPHICS -->

    <h2> Monthly Energy Usage by Building and Type</h2>  
    <p><i> This graphic gives some additional information that might not be fully apparent in the more summarizing graphics above. This graphic can be explored; each dot has details that pop up to give more information.</i></p>
